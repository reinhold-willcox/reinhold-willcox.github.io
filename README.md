A Responsive Free One Page Portfolio Website template

The reason there is both a master branch and an LSR branch is due to a funny feature of webhosting on github. 

Github.io has hardcoded that the master branch is the one that is read to the web, i.e the website that is 
viewed publicly. That is mostly fine.

I also found that there are issues with using xdg-open for html - there were some features of the website which worked with xdg-open
but not when viewed through the internet, and vice versa. 

So as a result, some testing must necessarily be done with the master branch - it is the only branch which can be properly viewed 
through the internet. The purpose of the LSR branch is to maintain only the best versions of each iteration of the website. i.e, 
it serves the usual purpose of the master branch. If I test something on master that I don't like and something goes wrong when
reverting it, I can always pull from LSR into master.
